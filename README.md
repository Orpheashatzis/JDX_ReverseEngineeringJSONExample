# Combatting Flight Delays

A Small Overview

## Milestone 1

We begin with the first milestone, The bulk. We highlight the 
problem we are attempting to resolve, Where we get our data from, and how we will
actually use our data to solve the problem.

### What are we trying to solve?

In the simplest terms, we aim to solve a problem affecting thousands of people
daily. Flight delays. They cause problems for travellers such as schedule disrupts,
money and time wasting, miss connecting flights etc. It also affects the airline.
They are likely to lose customers due to inefficient service causing customer disloyalty.

### Where will we get our data from?

Our data will be taken from pre-made data sets such as Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
or Kaggle

### How will we solve it?

In order to predict flight delays, we will look at historical flight data.
Here is a summary of the methods we will use: 

- Data Processing & Cleaning
   - Pandas for handling missing data, filtering and transforming columns
     
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn to visualize the flight delay trends
   - Analyze delays using time of day, day of week, airline and airport
   - Identify correlations
    
- Feature Engineering
   - Create new features like traffic congestion, past delay rates and weather

- Modelling & Evaluation
   - We use Scikit-learn for estimating delays
   - Measure performance with precision and recall

- Visualization Of Results
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn again for charting
   - Tableau or Dash for interactive boards that show predictions and trends

## Milestone 2

Milestone 2 primarily involves creating a video in which we provide a detailed walkthrough of our project, explaining its key components and overall objectives.

## Milestone 3

Milestone contains 2 parts.

### Milestone 3.1

Milestone 3.1 contains our data and scripts used to predict delays
We look at variables such as:
- FlightDate
- Airline
- Origin
- Destination
- Cancelled
- Diverted
- Departure Time
- Departure Delay (Minutes)
- Wheels off and on
- Arrival Delay

### Milestone 3.2

Milestone 3.2 consists of our presentation. We go over the entire project in 
detail and give further explinations.
